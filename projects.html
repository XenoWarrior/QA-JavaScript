                                    Site primarily developed in 2012 ~ 2014. What used to be the front facing site was my small text-based project called ProjectGE.
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    This project was developed originally for Age of Aincrad, another project I continue to work on today. 
                                    It serves as a way for the community to develop guilds, get to know people and prepare for the release of the game. 
                                    But has since developed into a small text-based mob grinding game, soon to have a story added with some Visual Novel elements. A visual novel engine has been wrote, checkout the <q>PHP Visual Novel Engine</q> below.
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    I had a successful IndieGoGo campaign which was mostly funded by the Age of Aincrad community which was successful! This helped to fund the server hosting solution for many years!
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    As of 2014/15, the site switched from ProjectGE being the front-facing website to the landing page. This is now primarily my e-portfolio to show off some of my current projects. But, a lot of the fun stuff lies in the back-end, these are shown below.

                                    PlayClient is a small MMO game I developed using a GameMaker: Studio game client and a C++ server.
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    This project was purely to test my TCP networking skills, and it started to expand into a slightly playable PvP (player-versus-player) game client. 
                                    It incorporates a basic quest system (which is not yet public), inventory systemm, server chat and character creation systems!
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    The server was primarily developed using a free open-source networking library called 39dll, but has since been switched to my own networking library, FYPNet.
                                    FYPNet was my Final Year Project for university, but has since been expanded even more to fit the needs of my MMO project.

                                    Primarily a project developed by myself and my other half, it was going serve as a engine for her story. But, she hasn't wrote the story yet.

                                    However, it can still be used dynamically! Plans are to implement this system into ProjectGE to provide a story related to Age of Aincrad. Not yet officially confirmed.

                                    This is a piece of software which has front-end client, XenUpdater. This client will connect to a server, read a patchlist file and download updates for any kind of software.
                                    It will only download the files which have changed in deployment, so clients do not need to download a whole new bundle each time!

                                    The source-code is currently private, but is currently getting a revamp which will be open-source to the public in the near future. You can follow the development at my GitHub.
